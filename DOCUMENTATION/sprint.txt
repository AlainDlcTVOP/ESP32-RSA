Explain how you have done the task
----------------------------------
V.34
1.  Sprintboard - github setup
2.  Server - we used a tutarial WiFi client/server and test if it gets Comminication thru the client
3.  Cilent - we used a tutarial WiFi client/server test to send a message 
4.  LED - tested to turn the internal led PIN_13 ESP_32 thru client
5.  Data -
6.  Ambient - BUG sensor broken 
7.  Report -   see on github 
8.  Branches - Test branches before refactor " Master - standard setup " " Develop the branch we push to "
               " Client -  developing " " Server developing " "Temp BUG " 

V.35
1.  homwork about the requierments 

V.35 The last sprint Implement the function from the LIB and make it work

V.36 step 1: generate AES-key.
step 2: encrypt the AES key using server private key.
step 3: encrypt the AES key using client public key.
step 4: calculate hash for AES-key.
step 5: create message1 (AES-key + hash)
step 6: send message1
step 7: recieve message2.
step 8: calculate hash for message2.
step 9: compare (calculated)hash for message2, with the hash recieved in message2.
step 10: decrypt message1 using AES chifer key.
Step 11: repeat step 7-10 forever.

NOTES :
-RSA is a method for encrypting and decrypting the message.
-It involves public key and private key, where the public key is known 
-to all and is used to encrypt the message whereas private key is only used to decrypt the encrypted message.
